                    <p>Having received a 2.1 grade in Business Information Systems
                        at National University of Ireland, Galway, I am leaving college behind
                        and starting a new chapter. I chose this degree having stumbled upon programming on <b>tumblr</b>
                        and from there I decided that I would explore this area as a profession.
                        I've had some exposure to web development having taken part in modules such as:
                    </br>
                    </br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Business Application Development I & II</li>
                            <li>Web & Interactive Media Design</li>
                            <li>E-Business Technologies</li>
                            <li>User Experience Design</li>
                        </ul>

                    </br>I have a great fundamental understanding of web development as I have learned many aspects
                        of application development both front end and back end (databases), as well as networks and commmunications
                        and the business side of the field through e-commerce and strategy.

                    <h3 class="sect-head highlight">Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>I have had many professional work experiences that have shaped me to this day.
                        Working with people inspires me to make someone's day a bit brighter. Most of my roles have consisted
                        of customer service through hospitality and retail industries.
                    </br>
                    </br> 
                        With KPMG, I got my first look into data analytics, and aspects of technology that I'd only read about in university.
                        It was a role that inspired me to choose the tech route as it interests me more. Working with data and searching for trends
                        was more than a job; it became fun! <b class="smiley">:)</b>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Looking into web development is something that I am working on religiously so that I may someday
                        get some hands-on experience with a company in the field.
